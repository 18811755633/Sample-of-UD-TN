# Sample-of-UD-TN
Supported by Major Scientific and Technological Projects for A New Generation of Artificial Intelligence of Tianjin (Grant No. 18ZXZNSY00300), we built UD-TN (Ultrasound Data-Thyroid Nodules) which is a dataset of thyroid ultrasound images. The original images of UD-TN were provided by Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. Specifically, UD-TN contains 2000 ultrasound images of the thyroid, of which 1400 are used for training and 600 images are used for testing. These images were classified into benign and malignant based on the results of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). There are 1012 benign images and 988 malignant images in UN-TN. At the same time, the senior radiologists labeled the size and location of the nodules in each image. In addition, in order to facilitate the evaluation of the model's ability to predict small nodules, we selected 100 ultrasound images of nodules with a maximum diameter of less than 1 cm from the testing set to form a small nodule testing set. 50 of them are benign and 50 are malignant.

The folder “Sample of Traindata” contains 14 image samples for training, including 7 benign images and 7 malignant images.
The folder “Sample of Testdata” contains 6 image samples for testing, including 3 benign images and 3 malignant images.
The folder “Sample of Smalltest” contains 6 image samples of small noduels for testing, including 3 benign images and 3 malignant images.
